This code is related to article "Reconstruction of Geological Images Based on an Adaptive Spatial Domain Filter: An Example to Introduce Quantum Computation to Geosciences" written by Sadegh Klanatri,Ali Madadi and Mehdi Ramezani.This code is written in Matlab 2016.

There are three codes named  "QuickTest","sample_building_code" and "Reconstructionwithspatialfilter" in this folder.The Code "QuickTest" is for quick test of the algorithm on Wall-Stone Image.The sample_building_code is used to sample the training image and the Reconstructionwithspatialfilter  is used to reconstruct the sampled image.
The Files stone5p,stone8p and stone16p are sampled images with percentages of 5, 8 and 16, respectively.The Image TI.jpg  is also the main image (Training image).



*****To run "QuickTest" it is enough to press Rune button.
*****To run "sample_building_code" it is enough to introduce the sampling_number(Total number of samples) in line 6 and training image in line 7. Then press Run  button. 
*****To run "Reconstructionwithspatialfilter", it is enough to introduce the training image in line 8 and the sampled image in line 11. Then press Run  button.
